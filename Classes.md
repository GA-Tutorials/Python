#Classes and Object Oriented Programming
Classes are an important part of python, it allows us to create objects and manipulate them through methods to reach our goals.
##Creating a class
Creating a class is simple, all it requires is one line of code.
``` python
class Example(object)
```
With our class created it we can begin to input an object.
##Initialize your object
One initialize command will allow you to create you objects.
``` python
def __init__(self, param)
	self.param = param
```
Here `param` is equivalent to any parameters that you wish to add.
