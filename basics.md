# Introduction

# Basic Syntax
 Hey! Now we'll be going over the basic syntax you'll need to use Python. To make this a bit easier, we'll provide the Javascript equivalent.
## Variable Declaration
In programming a variable is a name for value, similar to how "price" is a name for, "100"

## Printing


Here are a few examples:
  - pen = 10
  - pen_in_a_desk = 3
  - students = 5
You get the point. Also, variables can not be numbers.

## Math
 Before we begin i'll start by nameing them so you know what they are and they're uses:
 + plus | adds
 - minus | subtracts
 / slash | divides
 * asterisk | multiplies
 % percent | divides and returns the remainder
 < less than | comparater
 > greater than
 <= less than equal
 >= greater than equal





## Commenting

To make a multiline comment type " ''' ".  
If you're using a text editor, make comments by entering '#' before the line of code. To comment multiple lines of code highlight the lines hold CTRL then press the '/' code.


## Booleans

### Truth Terms

and,or, not, !=(not),==(equal), >=(greater than equal), <=(less than equal), True  False
