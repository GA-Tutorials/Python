# Introduction

# Basic Syntax
Hey! Now we'll be going over the basic syntax you'll need to use Python. To make this a bit easier, we'll provide the Javascript equivalent.
## Variable Declaration
Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.

This section will go over a few basic types of variables: Numbers &  Strings.

### Numbers
To define an integer, use the following syntax:

- myint = 7

### Numbers
Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes. Example:
 - mystring = 'hello'
 - mystring = "bye"


In programming a variable is a name for value, similar to how "price" is a name for, "100"



Here are a few examples:
  - pen = 10
  - pen_in_a_desk = 3
  - students = 5

You get the point. Also, variables can not be numbers.

## Printing
You'll use print() a whole lot in the future. Basically, all it does is output whatever is inside the parentheses.
Print is a function that we will go into later, but just understand that it can take a value. On the first line, we provide a string value "My first Python code!", which is a string because of the quotes. So, you just told Python to output that string to the console. Python completes that task and moves onto the next line where it prints out a different string.

Using the variables from the last section, you'll learn how to print strings:

- print(pen)
- print(pen_in_a_desk)
- print(students)

## Comments

To make a multiline comment type " ''' ".  
If you're using a text editor, make comments by entering '#' before the line of code. To comment multiple lines of code highlight the lines hold CTRL then press the '/' code.
