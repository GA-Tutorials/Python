# Basic Syntax
 Hey! Now we'll be going over the basic syntax you'll need to use Python. To make this a bit easier, we'll provide the Javascript equivalent.
## Variable Declaration
In programming a variable is a name for value, similar to how "price" is a name for, "100"

## Printing


Here are a few examples:
  pen = 10
  pen_in_a_desk = 3
  students = 5
You get the point. Also, variables can not be numbers.

## Math
 Before we begin i'll start by nameing them so you know what they are and they're uses:
 + plus | adds
 - minus | subtracts
 / slash | divides
 * asterisk | multiplies
 % percent | divides and returns the remainder
 < less than | comparater
 > greater than
 <= less than equal
 >= greater than equal
